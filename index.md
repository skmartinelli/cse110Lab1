## hi


im sam! im a second year computer science major in warren college. i am pretty new to programming (i started summer before my first year in SPIS at ucsd) but i enjoy it and try my best :'). my favorite language is python because it was my first language and because its easier for the things i like to do (why force make things hard when things are easy?). 

i havent really made any major, employer worthy projects yet but ive made a couple discord bots for fun. I "built" my own website but its just super basic html listing my github and linkedin and all that employer type stuff (partially because i thought it was funny, partially because... well ... easy). the link is [sammartinelli.com](sammartinelli.com) but prepare to be underwhelmed by what i describe as its 'tasteful minimalism'
