## hello!

/*
The purpose is to give an introduction of who you are as a programmer, who you are as a person, and any other interesting things you'd like to share with the kind of person who might be taking a look at your profile (think potential employers, open source devs, generally just the kinds of people who would be looking at the source code for a project you made).

im sam! im a second year computer science major in warren college. i am pretty new to programming (i started summer before my first year in SPIS at ucsd) but i enjoy it and try my best :'). my favorite language is python because it was my first language and because its easy LOL. i havent really made any major, employer worthy projects yet but ive made a couple discord bots for fun. I "built" my own website but its just super basic html listing my github and linkedin and all that (partially because i thought it was funny, partially because... well ... easy...). the link is [sammartinelli.com](sammartinelli.com) but prepare to be underwhelmed by what i describe as its 'tasteful minimalism.'

In the words of Lamar Davis from grand theft auto 5:
> don't hate me because im beautiful

i use `ls` and `git status` religiously in terminal because i have irrational fear if i dont check it every 30 seconds something will go horribly wrong
